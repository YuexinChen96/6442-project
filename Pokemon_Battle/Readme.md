<img src="Pokemon_Battle/src/Pics/demo/battle.png" width="800">

#### GUI
Top left: Enemy info bar (Name, HP bar, MP bar, attack - defence)  
Top right: Enemy icon  
Botton right: User info bar (Name, HP bar, MP bar, attack - defence)  
Botton left: User icon  
Botton: Turn information.

#### Control 
Right: HP poison(60% HP recover), MP poison(40 mana recover), leave the game.  
User control: Attack, Spell 1(20 mana cost), Spell 2(20 mana cost), Spell 3(80 mana cost).  
If mana is not enough for spell, we block this button, same as poisons. 

#### Turn System
Project uses **Turn** system: User turn -> Enemy turn -> User turn -> Enemy turn ... (Until User/Enemy loses all HP)  
If user loses all HP, it will redirect to the Game Over page.  
If user win the battle, it will redirect to the **Map**.  


#### Skills Setting (All skills have animations)
Attack: Use (Attack - Defence) and deal damage. No mana cost.  
Spell 1: 20 mana cost.  
Spell 2: 20 mana cost.  
Spell 3: 80 mana cost.(more powerful)

#### Spell Table

9|HP:-10% enemy_attack:-5|HP:-20% user_attack:-5

##### The skills for pokemons & enemies:
Name|Spell_1|Spell_2|Spell_3
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
Pokemon_1|0|1|10
Pokemon_2|2|3|11
Pokemon_3|4|5|12
Pokemon_4|6|7|13
Pokemon_5|8|9|14
Enemy_6|3|8|13
Enemy_7|5|9|14

Mana cost for user: 20, 20, 80  
Mana cost for enemy: 30, 30, 50


#### Enemy System
Enemy 1-4 can only attack the user.  
Enemy 5-6 can have two random spells from the spell table. When it has 30 mana, it will use random spell.  
Enemy 7(Advanced): predict whether use Spell_3 is optimal(die if use Spell_3)./Combo spell on 3 & 8.  
  If user_attack > enemy_attack: use 3 to increase attack, else use 8 to deal more damage.  
Enemy 8(Advanced): predict optimal from using Spell_3(check the HP spend on and the damage gain).  
  If current HP is low, use 5 to recover HP. Otherwise, use 9 to reduce use attack(permanent).  
Enemy 7 & 8 will think of use save mana for Spell_3.
